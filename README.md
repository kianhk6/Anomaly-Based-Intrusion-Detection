# Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection for Cyber-physical Systems

This repository contains the implementation of an anomaly detection system for analyzing household electricity consumption data using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The dataset and R scripts required for the analysis are included.
## Research Report

A detailed research report is available in this repository that analyzes the results of the anomaly detection model. This report provides insights into the methodology, results, and implications of the findings.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have R installed on your machine. You can download R from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/).

## Dataset

The dataset is included in the repository within a ZIP file named `dataset.zip`. Please extract this file to access the dataset.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone [URL-to-this-repository]
```
Navigate to the repository directory:
```
cd [repository-name]
```

## Setting Up Your Environment

Set the working directory in the beginning of each R script to the location of the extracted dataset files on your system. Modify the `setwd()` command at the start of each R script to point to your dataset directory.

## Running the Scripts

1. **Feature Scaling:**
   First, run the `featureScalling.R` script to standardize the features of the dataset. This script prepares the data for better performance in anomaly detection.
   ```
   Rscript featureScalling.R
   ```

2. **HMM Training and Anomaly Detection:**
   After scaling the features, run the `HMMTrainingAnamolyDetection.R` script to train the Hidden Markov Model and perform anomaly detection.
   ```
   Rscript HMMTrainingAnamolyDetection.R
   ```
